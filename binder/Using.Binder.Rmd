# Binder 

- This is a free, public demo of BinderHub the software BinderHub.
- Binder is a service that provides to your code, the hardware, and the software.

# Preparing a repository for Binder

## Supported configuration files list in the order of build priority

- Dockerfile
- environment.yml  
- requirements.txt 
- apt.txt
- REQUIRE
- postBuild

## environment.yml

This is a conda environment specification, that lets you install packages with conda (https://conda.io/docs/).

Example Contents
```yaml
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - matplotlib
  - pip:
    - pythran
```

## requirements.txt

This specifies a list of Python packages that should be installed in a virtualenv (or conda environment).

Example Contents

~~~
numpy==1.11
matplotlib==2.1
scipy
~~~

## apt.txt

A list of Debian packages that should be installed. The base image used is usually the latest released version of Ubuntu.

Example Contents

~~~
ffmpeg
graphviz
~~~

## REQUIRE

This file is dedicated to Julia language. It install julia 0.6 and packages listed in this file.

Example Contents

~~~
Optim
Plots
~~~

## postBuild
A script that can contain arbitrary commands to be run after the whole repository has been built. If you want this to be a shell script, make sure the first line is `#!/bin/bash`.

Example Contents

````bash
wget <url-to-dataset>
python myfile.py
```

### Note:
This file must be executable.

## Launching your Binder

- Go to mybinder.org and insert the URL for your git repository. 
- Press Launch to automatically create your Binder. 
- Binder will only build a new one if the git hashes don’t match.

## JupyterLab + Binder

1. Launch a Binder instance

2. Replace tree at the end of your URL with lab.
```
https://hub.mybinder.org/user/groupecalcul-canum-2018-la7iw4x1/tree
```

3. That’s it!
```
https://hub.mybinder.org/user/groupecalcul-canum-2018-la7iw4x1/lab
```

# R 

Binder supports using R + RStudio, with libraries pinned to a specific
snapshot on [MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/reproducibility).

You need to have a `runtime.txt` file that is formatted like:

```
r-<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>
```

where YYYY-MM-DD is a snapshot at MRAN that will be used for installing
libraries.

You can also have an `install.R` file that will be executed during build,
and can be used to install libraries.

Both [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [IRKernel](https://irkernel.github.io/)
are installed by default, so you can use either the Jupyter notebook interface or
the RStudio interface.

# Example

## Want to setup your own copy of mybinder.org? 

Then look at BinderHub and the "[Zero to BinderHub](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)" guide 

 ## Remarks
 
 - Everything that happens in a Binder session is destroyed when the user logs off or becomes inactive for more than a few minutes.
 

 - Never share sensitive or personal information within a Binder repository.
 

 - The maximum number of simultaneous users for a given repo is 100
 

 - You are guaranteed to have at least 1G of RAM. There is an upper-limit of 4GB.
 

 - Binder automatically shut down user sessions that have more than 10 minutes of inactivity
 

 - Binder aims to provide at least 12 hours of session time per user session.
 

 - Do not push information from a Binder session onto GitHub.
 

 - Configuration files may be placed in the root of your repository or in a **binder/** folder.
